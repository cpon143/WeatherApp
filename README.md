#WeatherApp
This is a remarkable weather application that allows users to access the current weather conditions of any city of their choice. The application was developed using the Kotlin programming language. For weather data, it uses the Open Weather API to retrieve the most recent weather conditions by city name, making it a reliable source of information.
